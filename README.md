## Projects

### 1. Breast Cancer Classification
- **Description**: This project aims to classify breast cancer images into malignant and benign categories using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the Breast Histopathology Images dataset available on Kaggle.
- **Key Techniques**: Data augmentation, transfer learning, and model evaluation using accuracy and F1 score.

### 2. Tumor Detection
- **Description**: This project focuses on detecting tumors using deep learning techniques in medical imaging.
- **Dataset**: MRI or CT scan images sourced from publicly available datasets.
- **Key Techniques**: U-Net architecture for image segmentation and evaluation metrics like IoU (Intersection over Union).
